I've always pondered how to succinctly describe myself. A woman, a mother, a hard learner, a fighter, a dreamer... What takes precedence? To be honest, I'm not entirely sure, but for now, let's go with 'hard learner' and 'dreamer'. Learning has always been my true passion. It might sound a bit 'cheesy', but it's the absolute truth. It's what led me to where I am today — fighting my way into the world of technology.

A few years ago, I had the opportunity to apply for a QA automation master class, which required a basic understanding of the Java programming language. It was during my preparations for that class that I truly fell in love with programming. Around the same time, I discovered a retraining program for IT organized by UNDP and the Government of Serbia. Naturally, I applied, passed, and that's when my real learning journey began. Our retraining program took place at the Faculty of Organizational Sciences in Belgrade. Looking back, I can confidently say it was quite a learning curve, going from ground zero to, well, certainly not a hero, but making substantial progress. I invested everything I had, both in time and dedication, to make this journey a reality.

And here I am today — a certified junior Java developer with enormous dreams and a determination to make them come true. Will I succeed? Stay with me to find out.

P.S. I've recently embarked on the journey of learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, and this is my very first project. I've seen the opportunity to learn more, share my knowledge, struggles, and thoughts on my path to becoming a full-stack developer."
